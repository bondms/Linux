* Installation notes for 16.04 *

During installation select the option to install 3rd party support so that H.264 support in FireFox will be enabled.
After installation uninstall flashplugin-installer to avoid Adobe vulnerabilities but still maintain H.264 HTML5 video support.

During installation select the option to encrypt users' home directories. This option also enable encrypted swap which can be configured manually, but is easiest to enable like this.

Use ext4 filesystem, it's still the distribution default for all partitions except /boot which--if separate--can be ext2 since it doesn't require journalling which takes up significant space on a small /boot partition.
