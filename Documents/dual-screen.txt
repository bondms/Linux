Use System/Administation/NVIDEA X Server Settings to enable "TwinView" mode.

The user manual for the video card says that the DVI-HDMI adapter only works in one of the outputs, this is not true.  Insead select the ouput depending on which screen is to be the primary.

# sudo nvidia-xconfig
allows nvidia-settings to parse the x-config file.

# sudo nvidia-settings
allows the configuration to be saved.

If Live CD halts with a blank screen try disconnecting the HDMI lead for the TV and rebooting.
