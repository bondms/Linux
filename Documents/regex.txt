Look-ahead is supported with Perl-style regex. It allow a match to be found using a larger portion of the string than is required to be provided back.

For example, to match files having a ".mp3" extension, followed by a '?' and (optionally) some other stuff but only provide the simple name (upto and exculding the '?') in the output:
# dir -1 | grep -o -P "^.*\.mp3(?=\?)"

Similarly, look-behind:
# grep -P -o "(?<=prefix).*"
will match strings starting with prefix, but exclude prefix from the output.

Be aware that single and double quotes have different behaviour with regard to variable expansion in sh.
