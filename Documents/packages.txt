To list installed packages:
# dpkg --get-selections

To list available packages:
# apt-cache pkgnames

Packages to uninstall:
- popularity-contest: May use high CPU (if software sources are configured to submit statistical information).
- scrollkeeper-update: Uses high CPU, but can't be easily removed due to dependancies.
- Old linux modules (after a kernel update), e.g. (for server installation):
- - linux-image-x.x.xx-xx-server
- - linux-ubuntu-modules-x.x.xx-xx-server 
- - This goes automatically: linux-headers-x.x.xx-xx
- - This goes automatically: linux-headers-x.x.xx-xx-server

If an unattended upgrade reports that it has held back packages then this is because it requires changes to dependecies. Resolve with:
# sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

To see installed packages from the CLI (e.g. for server version) use:
# apt-show-versions | less
# dpkg-query --show "linux-image*"

To determine which package a file belongs to:
# apt-file search <path-to-file>

To see configured options:
# apt-config dump

To re-configure a package:
# dpkg-reconfigure <package>
