To re-install GRUB2 on the MBR, e.g. after a Windows installation has blatted it.

- Boot from Live CD (Ubuntu 9.10 or later).
- Mount the Linux partition(s) having the root folder and (if it's on a different partition) the grub configuration folder (i.e. /boot/grub/...).
- From a command prompt execute:
    sudo grub-install --root-directory=<mnt-folder>/ /dev/<drive>
where:
    <mnt-folder> is the folder where the root has been mounted.
    <drive> is the disk (not partition) where the MBR is to be written (e.g. sda, not sda1)
- Reboot.

If a new kernel has broken startup, and the grub menu doesn't show at bootup to allow an alternative option then press and hold "shift" during bootup to access the menu.

If it's still possible to boot into Linux, but you want to re-install the MBR because (for example) the other OS has installed a boot loader that you don't like (for example by placing itself as the defaul) then boot into Linux and:

- sudo update-grub # Only required if there have been changes since the last grub was installed from this (e.g. you want to pick up the new OS).
- sudo grub-install --root-directory=/ /dev/<drive> # As above, <drive> is the drive, not the partition.
