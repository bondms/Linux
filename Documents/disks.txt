* Partitions *

- To wipe a disk from Linux Live CD:
# cat /dev/zero > /dev/sda
or
# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda

- Create partitions from Linux Live CD before installing any OS.

- Set Windows partition types to NTFS before running Windows installer, otherwise Windows will require the partition to be deleted and recreated (which it fails to do).

=== STACIE ===

Filesystems:
- sda1 and sda3 are ext4.
- sda2 is fuseblk/NTFS.

- Partitions created 3*325000MB + 1*<remaining>

$ sudo fdisk /dev/sda
[sudo] password for bondms: 

The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 121601.
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
and could in certain setups cause problems with:
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)

sda and sdb are small (5 Gb) drives for the root of the current and previous OS.
sdc is a larger (80 Gb) drive for the backup filesystem and swap.

Filesystems:
- sda1 and sdb1 are native ext4.
- sdc1 has been converted to ext4 from ext3.
