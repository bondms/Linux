*************************
* Encrypting partitions *
*************************

This works on removable devices such as USB flash pen-drives.

Partition as usual:
# sudo fdisk /dev/sd<n>

Format using LUKS:
# sudo luksformat [-t <fs>] /dev/sd<n><n> [-L <volume label>]

Default filesystem will be VFAT if not specified (then -L option is not supported).
Volume label is limited to 16 characters for ext4.
Ubuntu will automatically prompt for the passphrase when a removable device is inserted.
Note that umounting and remounts will NOT re-prompt for the passphrase unless the device has been removed and re-inserted.
However, using the gnome desktop icon "Unmount" right-click menu option does more than umount (since that does require the passphrase to be re-entered--perhaps uses cryptsetup to erase the key from memory?).
For SD cards, the device names are:
  - /dev/mmcblk0 (full device).
  - /dev/mmcblk0p1 (first partition).
